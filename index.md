## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using this application, follow the steps below. You will download the software and learn how to run it locally, even if you have no programming experience.

### 🌐 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js**: This software runs on Node.js. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MySQL**: This application needs a MySQL database. You can download it from [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/).

### 💻 Download & Install

To get the software, visit the Releases page:

[https://github.com/demoluci1/nodejs-auth-jwt/releases](https://github.com/demoluci1/nodejs-auth-jwt/releases)

1. Click the link above.
2. Look for the latest release at the top.
3. Download the files you need. Usually, you will want to get the source code as a ZIP file.

### 📂 Extract the Files

1. Once the download is complete, locate the ZIP file in your "Downloads" folder.
2. Right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract All" to unzip the files.
3. Choose a folder where you want to keep the application, then click "Extract."

### 🚀 Run the Application

1. Open a terminal. You can find the terminal application by searching for "Command Prompt" on Windows or "Terminal" on macOS.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Use the command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/folder` with your actual folder path.

3. Next, install the necessary packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Now, create a `.env` file in your folder to configure your database. Here's an example of what to include:

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=yourUsername
   DB_PASS=yourPassword
   DB_NAME=yourDatabaseName
   ```

   Replace `yourUsername`, `yourPassword`, and `yourDatabaseName` with your actual MySQL database details.

5. After setting up your `.env` file, run the application with the command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. The application should now be running on your local machine. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

7. You can now explore the API features for authentication and user management.

### 📚 Features

- **User Registration**: New users can register easily.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users with JWT.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
- **MySQL Integration**: Easily manage user data.

### 🛠️ Additional Setup 

If you want to further customize the application, here are some additional steps:

- **Database Setup**: You need to set up the MySQL database. Create a database with the name you specified in the `.env` file. You can use MySQL Workbench or the command line.
- **Sample Data**: You might want to insert some sample data to help you test the application.

### ⚙️ Common Issues

If you encounter any issues while running the application, check the following:

- Ensure your MySQL server is running.
- Verify your database credentials in the `.env` file.
- Check if Node.js is installed correctly by running:

  ```bash
  node -v
